# Blog


The purpose of this project is to learn html, css and javascript.

The goal of the project is to write down/script what I am learning in order to, as easy as possible, explain my ideas to others.

## FrontEnd

I want to dynamically render my webpages. I want to be able to transform my notes
into card-summaries on the frontpage as well as interactive and nice looking
blogposts.

## Routing

I need to get the routing to work in the
way I want.

* Learn full-stack development
* Draw my frontpage based on files on my
  server
* Automatically generate posts from a way
  I like to take notes.


## Fancy words

  the browser.
* Make a nice visualization for the
  words/phrases and their meanings.
