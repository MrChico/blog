# Blog


#### The purpose of this project is to learn html, css and javascript; web technologies;

* The goal of the project is to write down/script what I am learning in order to, as easy as possible, explain my ideas to others.
* Instead of having notes as separate markdown files I want to have one place where I can
  access all my notes and show my notes and ideas to others.
* Tools & design: 
  - React seems to like a good thing to know

#### Fancy words
"Fancy words" are words I come across when reading papers and I like the way the phrased something. 
It can be a single word with the associated meaning or a phrase of words.

This module would show these words in some nice way but also work as a <strong>practice</strong>  for <strong>POST-requests</strong> . I could have
a small file on the server which I could write to in order to make my "fancy words" vocabulary ever increasing.

Nice to have a shortcut on a mobile device to just input a word on the go.

Show "fancy" words I save from reading papers
