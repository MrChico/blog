# Blog

The purpose of this project is to learn html, css and javascript.

The goal of the project is to write down/script what I am learning in order to, as easy as possible, explain my ideas to others.


## Todo

#### Switch view engine

Jade/Pug is not perfect. I think I prefer to just code in basic html and handlebars is much more similar than pug.


#### Change to CSS grid

* Use firefox for preview (shows grid)
* [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp)

#### dropdown menu for notes

* Notes should become a dropdown menu
  where one can choose between the
  different chategories of notes.

* A "frontpage" for notes leading to the
  chategory pages if dropdown menu is not
  used.


#### Fancy words

"Fancy words" are words I come across when reading papers and I like the way the phrased something. 
It can be a single word with the associated meaning or a phrase of words.

This module would show these words in some nice way but also work as a <strong>practice</strong>  for <strong>POST-requests</strong> . I could have
a small file on the server which I could write to in order to make my "fancy words" vocabulary ever increasing.

Nice to have a shortcut on a mobile device to just input a word on the go.

Show "fancy" words I save from reading papers

* Learn how to work with json querys in
  the browser.
* Make a nice visualization for the
  words/phrases and their meanings.

This was a good tutorial on express which made me start using jade/pug again. Speed 2x though...
