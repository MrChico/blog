# Blog

The purpose of this project is to learn html, css and javascript.

The goal of the project is to write down/script what I am learning in order to, as easy as possible, explain my ideas to others.


### Markdown notes -> Blog

1. [x] Read markdown and output as html
  * Solved through showdown-js
2. [ ] Make summaries as short html shown in "card"


#### Fancy words

"Fancy words" are words I come across when reading papers and I like the way the phrased something. 
It can be a single word with the associated meaning or a phrase of words.

This module would show these words in some nice way but also work as a <strong>practice for POST-requests</strong> . I could have
a small file on the server which I could write to in order to make my "fancy words" vocabulary ever increasing.

Nice to have a shortcut on a mobile device to just input a word on the go.

Show "fancy" words I save from reading papers
