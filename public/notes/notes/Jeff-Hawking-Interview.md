### Talking bout layers.
Location, allocentric, S1/egocentric, M1.
[Allocentric vs Egocentric](http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/mkozhevnlab/?page_id=308)

* Egocentric (Self-to-object):
  * In relationship to the `I`'s body. Left/Right, Front/Back, Up/Down.
* Allocentric(Object-to-object):
  * One object or its parts with respect to other objects.

Inference on dual representations.

What and where:
--------------

Example:

Damage to either the `what` or `where` structures in vision might:
  * Able to see where the object is very clearly, able to reach the object without problem. However,
    can not tell what it is at all. or
  * Being able to see what kind of an object it is but have no notion of where it is, is not able at
    all to reach the object. However, can state clearlay what it is.

Columns = [list of cols]

Every columns is trying to learn everything in its scope.
Same as capsule networks argue.

[Brain Oscillations](http://www.brainworksneurotherapy.com/what-are-brainwaves) in brain waves (Theta/beta/gamma) do they have an important function in the brain?
