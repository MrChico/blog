Paraphrasing wikipedia:

The mel scale is a perceptual scale of pitches judged by listeners to be equal in distance
from one another. The name <strong>mel</strong> comes from the word <strong>melody</strong> to indicate that the scale is based on <strong>pitch
comparisons.</strong> [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scale)


### Mel-frequency Cepstrum Coefficients

In sound processing, the mel-frequency cepstrum (MFC) is a representation of the
short-term power spectrum of a sound, based on a linear cosine transform of a log power
spectrum on a nonlinear mel scale of frequency.
