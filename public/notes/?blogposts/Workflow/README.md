Workflow has become a word of large importance both in a professional but also
for pleasure. Workflow is everything. What do you do during a day? Thats your
workflow. Workflow is a nice concept because it is what you want to
design/produce/understand, the reason why to design/produce/understand **and**
the tool to  design/produce/understand.
