## Most important research areas
### World

* Learn to learn: Artificial General Intelligense
* Intent, small talk conversations and the following dangers of manipulation.
 * What are Google/Facebook/amazon/apple doing with all the data?
 * How much do the save? What variables are stored in connection to "events" ( read:
   phrases/communication, context and intent.
* What could a group of people do with this data if it is owned together?

### Personal or industriproduct
#### Open Source free (dicatafon)

With the ability to talk to my computer and have it translate audio to text and store both
ready for analyis I could:
* Take notes faster for learning and monitoring.
* Store all data and relate ideas about NLP to this slowly expanding but personal dataset.

* More energy left for structuring ideas?
* More time left for exercise?

1. Mycroft Skill
  * There was a forum post about skills and a user asked about having the ability to
    dictate.

### Reconnect to session or Checkpoint save
* A video showing a clip labeled product (note-markdown, code-snippet, notebook)
* A reading by TTS of "summary" 

# Summary

</div>
```


# Mycroft sync through that system. Connect to the mycroft project.

But mycroft seems to be a great starting point for using a dictation device.
Controlled with wakeword from mycroft. How open source is it? Can one start working
there?
