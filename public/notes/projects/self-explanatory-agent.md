# Self Explanatory Agent

## Introduction

A babbling Agent playing a game. The end.



An agent playing a game, RL setup, but all actions are multi-modal. An action is a set of motor-skilled based (motoric- ?) actions and their spoken representation, their linguistic meaning, their semantical meaning. This could be useful for interoperability listen to the agent explain what it does in an temporal end-to-end fashion.


### Background
I walk around and talk to myself. Both unconsciously in a classic <strong>"lost in thought"</strong>  way and purposefully when I think and work out concepts. My thinking is closely condition on talking because I often use the generative linguistic(language) model but without the transformation to motoric signals in my mouth and throat.


## Prerequisites
* Voice
* Language

Really it is the <strong>action-phrasing mapping</strong> which is all that is not known. Generate
sentences for actions, the inverse of action understanding/classification. AI complete,
analagous to NP-complete.
