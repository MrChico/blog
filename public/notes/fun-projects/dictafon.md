### Personal or industriproduct
#### Open Source free (dicatafon)

With the ability to talk to my computer and have it translate audio to text and store both
ready for analyis I could:
* Take notes faster for learning and monitoring.
* Store all data and relate ideas about NLP to this slowly expanding but personal dataset.

* More energy left for structuring ideas?
* More time left for exercise?

1. Mycroft Skill
  * There was a forum post about skills and a user asked about having the ability to
    dictate.

### Reconnect to session or Checkpoint save
* A video showing a clip labeled product (note-markdown, code-snippet, notebook)
* A reading by TTS of "summary" 

# Summary 

<div class="summary">
  <img src="/images/notes/vim/checkpoint.*" alt=""/>
  Hello, vad st책r h채r?
</div>

```html
<div class="summary">
  <img src="/images/notes/vim/checkpoint.*" alt=""/>
  Hello, vad st책r h채r?
</div>
```

# Mycroft sync through that system. Connect to the mycroft project.
But mycroft seems to be a great starting point for using a dictation device.
Controlled with wakeword from mycroft. How open source is it? Can one start working
there?
