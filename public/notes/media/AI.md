# Introduction

Perhaps one good approach for me personally is to let my curiosity control my workflow from time to time. Starting many different projects at once, trying to save and document all progress as much as possible. On a personal level this behavior is something I seem to want to suppress. I feel a lot that made my life more tedious than it could have been is because of this behavior. The behavior, I now realize,  is to not deliver, to finish a project, to follow through. However, the point here is to not focus on those thoughts but to actually completely experience how following my curiosity turns out. I am on vacation and thusly I may experience with these matters without shame.

Artificial Intelligence is a broad, or perhaps the broadest, line of inquiry there is. This is true in the same manner that it is true for philosophy of consciousness and existentialism. This is because of the recursive nature of the quest. How to understand what is trying to understand. AI is the pursuit of the ability to have the knowledge to replicate this phenomena in practice. 

A basic starting point to pursue this quest is to think about the kinds of data beings that are intelligent has been constrained to. Data and information seems to be the correct level of complexity to formulate theories around living beings, intelligent beings and consciousness. We axiomatically start from realism and materialism, the notion that time has a direction and constrain the argumentation to inside of the observable universe with geology, biology, chemistry and physics being the best objective description of objective reality that we have yet to come up with. The level of complexity of human beings is in the "lagom" zone where both smaller and larger systems tend to be more simple than the systems that are us. In this level of complexity the best units to utilize in argument are data and information. What does DNA really code? How can DNA store the information to build consciousness and conscious agents? It is absurd! From one level I can not get my head around how to even code for a cell of anything. It is so fascinating that it is constrained to code for the builders and the way to construct these entities.  It is a self replicator and on this planet a very efficient one. Is consciousness an emergent property of any self replicator of a certain efficiency and on a certain level of complexity?

A self replicator operates is described by Dawkins in the selfish gene and its food source is stability. Stability is the only way to incentivize anything out of the universe.  Because the existence of stability seems to be present in the laws governing nature we have a system constructed around this were the name of the game is to just be around. If you are a system and exist you can be compared to other systems that exists and analyze which system seems more capable of staying in existence. A rock is in existence and may "outlive" any form of more complex system but it did so using "technology" from a lower level of complexity. It was based on the crystalline property of minerals operating on a lever of complexity best described by deterministic almost Newtonian mathematical formulations. A true self replicator was first constructed by DNA and the multicellular organism. How can a system encode information to create the minds of intelligent system?  What is the purpose of an intelligent system? 

So an intelligent system can infer future events based on prior events and operate in the material world as to avoid external dangers and keep the system intact and in the game of life. Here it is assumed that intelligence emerged after simple sensory systems were created in order to be the "in" part of a simple input and output relationship (function).  Multiple different <strong>sensory behavioral life organs</strong>  evolved somewhat independently. At the beginning they were almost unconstrained by eachother and had minimal inter-organ-dependence. However, because of the fact that they were attach to the same physical systems the more influence they exerted on this system the more effect the sensory behavioral life organs had on each other. In order to keep improving upon old technology a meta system had to be evolved choreographing these previously independent systems. This is what I think I mean by intelligence. For this system the goal was to relate how sensory systems in the agent would effect the future and thus other sensory systems. The information of the past, the present and the future was vital and how it relates to the information and ability of the internal systems of the agent. Some sensory organs were more general than others based on what type of data they encoded, utilized, was their the purpose of their existence. This is data that encodes information about things happening on a larger distance around the agent. These would be sight and hearing.  These senses made it possible to communicate inter-agent style. This communication possibility led to the development of language, speech and gestures. These abilities meant that agents were not constrained to only coordinate the internal system inside the agent but larger systems through cooperation between agents.  The coordination of the internal system led to feelings and experiences, urges and behavior. An experience is the snapshot of the entire rollout from a specific moment in time.  Here rollout is figuratively related to the rollout of recurrent networks. A tree like structure from the past to the now. Language is a way to encode information of a subset of experience. Experience is the thing that relates all living organisms and is the abstract form of what can be communicated between living agents. A memory is a dimensionality reduction of experiences (or is it possible that the way the brain works may encode just copies and copies of experiences?). Probably a memory is a diluted version of an experience but has the advantage that it is stored through time and may relate to new experiences and memories as the agent keeps existing.  

Experiences, however complex, are always built from smaller building blocks which I mean are the sensory data. Intelligence is the way to relate sensory data and their effect on the outside world. [Free Energy Principle]()

The laws of nature are presented as the universe cools down. Like throwing a bucket of paint (read: material) on the underlying properties of the universe to see their shapes.  But instead of paint getting stuck on material it is material of the universe that is cooling and forms patterns through time.
