Saw this talk on my phone in bend and he seemed to be talking about a nice thing. A really
good source to learn about grid is [GridByExample](https://gridbyexample.com/) by [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/). Thank you Rachel!

The blog now has a layout defined by three grids the header, content and footer. Inside of
the content container the layout is page specific. In notes it is a simple two-column
structure with a sidenav and a main/article column. The major advantage of using grid is
in the [index content container](/). Which I have not started working on.

-----------------------

### Index container 

1. Get summary of all notes.
2. Create card
  * CSS
  * Read-more button w/ link
3. video-menu should do the same but only make video summary cards.

-----------------------

### Surface Onenote drawing to blog

1. Find an easy way to get images drawn on my surface to the blog
2. Perhaps a simpler POST - scheme where an image and a summary is pushed to the server.
