Saw this talk on my phone in bend and he seemed to be talking about a nice thing. A really
good source to learn about grid is [GridByExample](https://gridbyexample.com/) by [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/). Thank you Rachel!

The blog now has a layout defined by three grids the header, content and footer. Inside of
the content container the layout is page specific. In notes it is a simple two-column
structure with a sidenav and a main/article column. The major advantage of using grid is
in the [index content container](/). Which I have not started working on.

-----------------------
### Index container 
1. Get summary of all notes.
2. Create card
  * CSS
  * Read-more button w/ link
3. video-menu should do the same but only make video summary cards.

-----------------------
### Googe draw.io diagrams  
1. See if the html is useful


-----------------------
### Small header in note articles
1. It is nice to see clearly the header for the "blogpost"
2. Barely visible cklickable links to git and hamburger menu? Opacity? Animation?

### Tensorflow.js [TSNE](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-tsne)

### Notes in html

* Common snippets

### Hide/Show Gists 

Have a clickable "link" that shows embedded gist.
Now: Embedded gifs without css tweak.
