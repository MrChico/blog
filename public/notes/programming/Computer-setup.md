# Computer Setup

A post containing an interface to my computer setup. This is the starting point for a fresh computer initialization. This repo contains all the config files, linkers and developer tools.

Full installation can be found in [README](https://github.com/ErikEkstedt/.files/blob/master/README.md) but is essentially using these tools:
1. [Dotfiles](https://github.com/ErikEkstedt/.files) repository
2. Setup/workflow heavily depends on Vim and tmux.
3. SSH
4. Synergy
5. Mycroft

## Install Linux on MacbookPro 2017

<strong>:bulb: WARNING: Wifi is not working correctly (no 5GHz) :bulb:</strong> 

The most complete sources:
* [State of Linux on the MacBook Pro 2016 & 2017](https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux)
* [Linux on MBP](https://gist.github.com/roadrunner2/1289542a748d9a104e7baec6a92f9cd7#file-0-linux-on-mbp-late-2016-md)

[Linux on mid-2017 MacbookPro](https://nixaid.com/linux-on-macbookpro/): Tutorial that
fixes touchpad/keyboard before install [Advanced].

Fix for wifi:
`sudo iwconfig wlp3s0 txpower 10dBm`
Once set wifi 2.4GHz works, home router, mobile phone and eduroam.
(I have not found a way to implement this at startup in kde. Tried writing in `rc.local`
but did not work and I did not try much more.)



Prerequisites: usb for boot, usb keyboard and mouse
1. [Partition hard-drive](https://www.lifewire.com/dual-boot-linux-and-mac-os-4125733) 
  * disk utility set `MD-DOS(FAT)`
2. Keyboard and touchpad does not work out of box
  * [mbp](https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux#keyboard--touchpad)


### Why Kde over MacOs?

Linux is open-source and great. I want to run linux on all devices as much as I can.

Detail: A detail was that my workflow was interrupted by the inability to make
cmd-hotkeys/shortcuts as I wish. The major thing was to use cmd-hjkl in terminal for
moving around. This can of course be fixed and because of the bad WiFi property I have to
fix this instead of dual booting. I am sad that I can't run Linux on my MBP :(

## SSH

All computers needs to run both client and server ssh such that all computers can get files from all other computers.
* Source: [zdueyb Blog](https://dev.to/zduey/how-to-set-up-an-ssh-server-on-a-home-computer)
* Install: 
  * `sudo apt-get install openssh-client` 
  * `sudo apt-get install openssh-server` 
* Configure 
  * script [init.sh](https://github.com/ErikEkstedt/.files/blob/master/ssh/init.sh)

### SSHFS
Mount a ssh connection to a local directory to more easily access and copy/paste many files.
