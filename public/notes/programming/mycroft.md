## Introduction

Mycroft is an open source voice assistant

> Mycroft is the name of a suite of software and hardware tools that use natural language processing and machine learning to provide an open source voice assistant.

> As of late 2017, Mycroft is undergoing heavy development. It is at a level of maturity where developers and hardware hobbyists will be able to use it effectively. However, it is not yet ready for mainstream adoption.
