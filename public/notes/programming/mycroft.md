# Introduction

Mycroft is an open source voice assistant

> Mycroft is the name of a suite of software and hardware tools that use natural language processing and machine learning to provide an open source voice assistant.

> As of late 2017, Mycroft is undergoing heavy development. It is at a level of maturity where developers and hardware hobbyists will be able to use it effectively. However, it is not yet ready for mainstream adoption.


# [Install for linux](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/blob/dev/README.md)

#### 1. Clone repo

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core.git
cd mycroft-core
bash dev_setup.sh
```

#### 2. Run dev_setup.sh

The <strong>[dev_setup.sh](dev_setup.sh)</strong> script installs the dependencies below (taken from the scirpt):

```bash
pt-get install -y \
  git python3 python3-dev python-setuptools \
  python-gobject-2-dev libtool libffi-dev libssl-dev autoconf \
  automake bison swig libglib2.0-dev portaudio19-dev mpg123 \
  screen flac curl libicu-dev pkg-config automake libjpeg-dev \
  libfann-dev build-essential jq
```

#### 3. Start Mycroft

Run `start-mycroft.sh debug` to start mycroft. This command starts all services and also the CLI-ui.

```bash
 âžœ ./start-mycroft.sh debug
Starting all mycroft-core services
Initializing...
Create /opt/mycroft/skills
Changing ownership of /opt/mycroft to user: erik with group: erik
changed ownership of '/opt/mycroft/skills' from root:root to erik:erik
changed ownership of '/opt/mycroft' from root:root to erik:erik
Starting background service bus
Starting background service skills
Starting background service audio
Starting background service voice
```

#### 4. Investigate code

When mycroft is installed it creates and operates in a virtual environment and in order to easily
access this environment I created an alias to source it. I first checked the `start-up.sh` script to
see where the environment was created. (I use zsh).

```bash
alias somy="source $HOME/mycroft-core/.venv/bin/activate"
```

Make sure to soure/restart/refresh the terminal such that the new virtual environment is actually
running. After sourcing the virtual environment execute `which pip` in order to see that the correct
pip is used. Mycroft is written in python and so `pip install ipython` will help to check code
snippets and create code.

## Server

## Speech

## Audio

## Skills

The skills mycroft utilizes are installed through the CLI-command 
`msm install` where msm is the mycroft skill manager. All the skills are git-repos cloned into `/opt/mycroft/skills/` and when mycroft is
started the loading procedure is shown in the cli-ui.

I encountered trouble installing the [desktop-launcher](https://github.com/MycroftAI/skill-desktop-launcher) skill. It complained that I did not have the `gi` module installed.


```bash
sudo apt install libgirepository1.0-dev
```

Where is the config and how is the quickest way to test if config is working?
