# Training

I need to start a training regime that I can keep up for practically the rest of my life. 
In order to achieve this I need the training to be fun, not too exhausting and executed in defined
time slots. I need to slowly progress and reach a point I define as a stable baseline. I believe
that yoga and some flexibility training could be really beneficial and need to look into how to add
such exercises to my life. The workout in general is place agnostic meaning that  workouts can be
performed at home, at the gym, outside or somewhere.


<strong>Points</strong>
* Whole body exercises!
  * Coordination
  * Small stabillizing muscles
* Back and neck training to "combat" my daily office wear and tear
* Cardiovascular training

<strong>Important exercises</strong>
* Deadlift
* Pull-ups
* Squat
* Bench-press
* Kettlebell swings 
* Burpees

<strong>Yoga</strong>
* How to start?
* How do I want to practice?


## Lets go!


This week will be the start of my new training regime. This first week has two major rules:

* Train at least 3 times
* Use all the <strong>Important exercises</strong> at least once.
